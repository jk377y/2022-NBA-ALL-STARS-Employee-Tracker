Your assignment this week is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.
<br>

## Description
This is a command line application that can display a list of employees, their roles and departments.  There is the ability to add and delete these also.

<br>

## Installation
You must have node.js installed on your system.<br>
You can run [npm install] to install all the required npm packages.<br>
The packages that will be imported are:
    <br>&emsp;1) MYSQL2
    <br>&emsp;2) INQUIRER
    <br>&emsp;3) CONSOLE.TABLE
    <br>&emsp;4) DOTENV
    <br>&emsp;5) CHALK
<br>

## Usage
To start the program, open the command terminal from the root directory.
Type [npm start].  This will run the script file that executes the command [node server.js]
Once the program loads, you will be presented with the main menu and can view, add, or delete as you wish.
